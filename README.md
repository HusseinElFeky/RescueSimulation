# Rescue Simulation

The Rescue Simulation is based on concepts of the RoboCup, an annual international robotics competition proposed and founded in 1996 by a group of university professors.

This is a very simple game that demonstrates it using Java and OOP concepts.

## Note:

The game definitely has a vast room for improvement, but since this was a project for a mandatory course in college, we were strictly required to follow the game description as exactly mentioned in the [description](https://github.com/HusseinElFeky/RescueSimulation/tree/master/description) folder, and we were not allowed to modify the game implementation/mechanism or change any existing features or add new ones.

The folder consists of 5 files: **Game Description, 3 Milestones, Bonus Features**. These are the documents that we followed during game development. Each file is described briefly below.

### Game Description:

This document just provides a detailed description of the game elements and gameplay. It does not contain any implementation or coding details.

### Milestone 1:

This milestone is the first exercise on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

**Deliverables:**

- A packaging hierarchy for the code
- An initial implementation for all the needed data structures
- Basic data loading from csv files

### Milestone 2:

This milestone is a further exercise on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

**Deliverables:**

- A working game engine with all of its logic that can be played on the console if needed.

### Milestone 3:

This milestone is the last exercise on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

**Deliverables:**

- Adding and handling all exceptions that could arise during the gameplay
- Implementing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the game

### Bonus Features:

This document introduces the possible bonus features that one could add to the game. One could only choose one feature to get the bonus. We chose bonus feature #3 (Computer-Assisted Gameplay). One needed to design a simple computer companion to help the player decide what to do next. A recommendation system was implemented to take into consideration the current status of all game objects, then recommends the best moves possible.

## Contribution:

The project team consisted of 3 members:

- [@m-abdelwahab](https://github.com/m-abdelwahab)

Any other contribution to this project will mostly be disregarded, since the project is not for industrial use; it is only for educational purpose. However anyone can surely fork it and play/experiment with it.
